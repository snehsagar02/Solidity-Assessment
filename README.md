## MyToken Solidity Contract
This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of minting and burning tokens. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how to create and manage a token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description
This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, maintaining a total supply of tokens, and keeping track of balances associated with addresses.

## Getting Started
Requirements
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org.

## Executing the Program
### Create a New File:

### Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar.
Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Copy and Paste the Code from the contracts folder.
